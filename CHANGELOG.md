- specify explicit versions for dependencies
- revert BeautifulSoup copying added in 1.1.1 due to bugs (eg #108)
- misc performance improvements

## 1.1.1 - 2018-06-15

- streamline backcompat to use JSON only.
- fix multiple mf1 root rel-tag parsing
- correct url and photo for hreview.
- add rules for nested hreview. update backcompat to use multiple matches in old properties.
- fix `rel-tag` to `p-category` conversion so that other classes are not lost.
- use original authored html for `e-*` parsing in backcompat
- make classes and rels into unordered (alphabetically ordered) deduped arrays.
- only use class names for mf2 which follow the naming rules
- fix `parse` method to use default html parser.
- always use the first value for attributes for rels.
- correct AM/PM conversion in datetime value class pattern.
 - add ordinal date parsing to datetimes value class pattern. ordinal date is normalised to YYYY-MM-DD
- remove hack for html tag classes since that is fixed in new BS
- better whitespace algorithm for `name` and `html.value` parsing
- experimental flag for including `alt` in `u-photo` parsing
- make a copy of the BeautifulSoup given by user to work on for parsing to prevent changes to original doc
- bump version to 1.1.1

## 1.1.0 - 2018-03-16

- bump version to 1.1.0 since it is a "major" change
- added tests for new implied name rules
- modified earlier tests to accommodate new rules
- use space separator instead of "T"
- Don't add "00" seconds unless authored
- use TZ authored in separate `value` element
- only use first found `value` of a particular type `date`, `time`, or `timezone`.
- move backcompat rules into JSON files
- reorganise value class pattern parsing into new files
- add datetime_helpers to organise datetime parsing rules
- reorganise tests
- remove Heroku frontend, point to mf2py-web and python.microformats.io instead in README.
- remove Flask and gunicorn requirements
- add debug info with description, version, url and the html parser used 

## 1.0.6 - 2018-03-04

- strip leading/trailing white space for `e-*[html]`. update the corresponding tests
- blank values explicitly authored are allowed as property values
- include `alt` or `src` from `<img>` in parsing for `p-*` and `e-*[value]`
- parse `title` from `<link>` for `p-*` resolves #84
- and `poster` from `<video>` for `u-*` resolves #76
- use `html5lib` as default parser
- use the final redirect URL resolves #62
- update requirements to use BS4 v4.6.0 and html5lib v1.0.1
- drop support for Python 2.6 as html5lib dropped support

## 1.0.5 - 2016-05-09

- Implied property checks now ignore alt="", treating it the same as
  if no alt value is defined.
- Support for using a custom dict implementation by setting
  mf2py.Parser.dict_class. collections.OrderedDict yields much nicer
  output for hosted parsers.

## 1.0.4 - 2016-03-21
### Changed
- Performance improvement changing simple calls to soup.find_all to
  a manual iteration over .contents.

## 1.0.3 - 2016-02-05
### Changed
- Performance improvement by limiting number of calls to soup.find_all
  in backcompat module. Should not be any functional changes.

## 1.0.2 - 2016-01-26
### Added
- Backward compatibility parsing for rel=tag properties. These are now converted
  to p-category based on the last path segment of the tag URI as spec'd in
  http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Parser_Compatibility
- Optional property html_parser to specify the html parser that BeautifulSoup
  should use (e.g., "lxml" or "html5lib")

## 1.0.1 - 2015-12-11
### Changed
- `u-*` properties are now parsed from `<link>` elements per the updated spec
  http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing-issues#link_elements_and_u-_parsing

## 1.0.0 - 2015-10-05
### Changed
- Version number bumped to 1.0.0 following community discussion.

## 0.2.8 - 2015-09-21
### Changed
- Stricter checks that Parser.__init__ params are actually None before
  ignoring them.

## 0.2.7 - 2015-08-03
### Changed
- Now produces unicode strings for every key and value, no more byte
  strings anywhere.
- Do not add 'T' between date and time when normalizing dates
### Added
- Unit tests for running the microformats test suite

## 0.2.6 - 2015-05-06
### Added
- New top-level "rel-urls" entry, contains rich data parsed from rel
  links, organized by URL.

## 0.2.5 - 2015-03-01
### Added
- convenience method `mf2py.parse` that takes the same arguments as Parser
  and returns a dict.
### Changed
- nested h-* classes now parse their "value" based on the property
  they represent (p-*, u-*, dt-*), so for example "p-in-reply-to
  h-cite" would have a name as its value and "u-in-reply-to h-cite"
  will have a URL.

## 0.2.4 - 2015-02-13
### Added
- Add rel=bookmark to backward compat parsing rules based (translated
  to u-url in mf2)
### Changed
- Parser constructor now takes explicit named arguments instead of
  **kwargs, for saner behavior when called with unnamed arguments.
- Bugfix: Empty href="" attributes are now properly interpreted as
  the current document's URL.

## 0.2.3 - 2015-02-07
### Changed
- Minor Py3 compatibility fix
- Correct typo `test_requires` -> `tests_require` in setup.py

## 0.2.2 - 2015-02-05
### Changed
- Started keeping a changelog!
- Use a better method for extracting HTML for an e-* property
- Correct BeautifulSoup4 dependency in setup.py to fix error with
  installation from PyPI.
- Buffed up docstrings for public methods.
